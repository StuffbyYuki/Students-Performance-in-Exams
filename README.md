# Students-Performance-in-Exams

- Data analysis conducted on the datset found on Kaggle <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams">Dataset</a>
- This dataset is great for begginners for the data doesn't contain too many rows & columns, so you can focus on the analysis as well as its process.
- That means if you're looking forward to getting your hands dirty just on the data cleaning/manipulation part, you might be disappointed. This analysis contains some data cleaning/manipulation part though.
- You can see the code here on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/yuki19940627/notebooks">Kaggle Notebooks</a> as well.

## Step 1 - Exploratory data analysis
- Programming language used: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn).
- Written in Google Colab Notebook.
- Some data cleaning/manipulation was done utilizing Python Pandas library. And correlation analysis was done using data visualizations with seaborn library.
## Step 2 - Statistical analysis
- Coming soon
## Step 3 - Building a predotive model
- Coming soon
